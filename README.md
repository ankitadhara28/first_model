## ðŸ“˜ Part 1 â€“ Predicting Prices Using Area
*File:* StartToModel_part1.ipynb  
*Description:*  
A simple linear regression model that predicts house prices based only on the area.

*How to Run:*
1. Open StartToModel_part1.ipynb
2. Run all cells in order

## ðŸ“— Part 2 â€“ Predicting Prices Using Area, Bedrooms, and Age
*File:* StartToModel_part2.ipynb  
*Description:*  
An enhanced model that predicts prices using area, number of bedrooms, and age of the house.

*How to Run:*
1. Open StartToModel_part2.ipynb
2. Run all cells in order

## ðŸ§  Future Parts
Iâ€™ll keep adding more parts as I explore new features and algorithms.
