# StartToModel Project

This repository contains a series of small ML projects Iâ€™m building while learning machine learning.

## ðŸ“˜ Part 1 â€“ Predicting Prices Using Area
*File:* start_to_model.ipynb  
*Description:*  
A simple linear regression model that predicts house prices based only on the area.

*How to Run:*
1. Open StartToModel_part1.ipynb
2. Run all cells in order

## ðŸ“— Part 2 â€“ Predicting Prices Using Area, Bedrooms, and Age
*File:* start_to_model_2_part2.ipynb  
*Description:*  
An enhanced model that predicts prices using area, number of bedrooms, and age of the house.

*How to Run:*
1. Open StartToModel_part2.ipynb
2. Run all cells in order

## ðŸ“˜Part 3 â€“ Predicting Salaries Using Experience, Test Score, and Interview Score

**File:** start_to_model_3.ipynb

**Description:**  
A practical machine learning model that predicts employee salaries based on experience, test performance, and interview scores. The dataset includes text-based experience values converted into numbers using the `word2number` library for accurate predictions.

**How to Run:**  
Open `StartToModel_part3.ipynb`  
Run all cells step by step to view data cleaning, training, and prediction results

## ðŸ§  Future Parts
Iâ€™ll keep adding more parts as I explore new features and algorithms.
